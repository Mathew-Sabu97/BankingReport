<h1>Customer Retention Report</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I have explored various dimensions of customer exit behavior to understand why customers might leave a bank, such as account inactivity or failing to maintain a minimum balance. The dashboard captures KPIs like total customers by year, exit rates by account type, and segmentation based on credit score and demographics.
<br />

<h2> Visualization Used </h2>

- <b>Card</b>  <br/>
The cards provide a quick overview of key metrics, including the Total Customers, Active Customers, Inactive Customers, Credit Card Holders, Non-Credit Card Holders, Exit Customers, and Retain Customers. Each card highlights a specific customer segment or status, allowing users to understand overall customer distribution and retention at a glance.

<br />

- <b>Clustered Column Chart</b>  <br/>
This chart shows Total Customers by Year and Active Category (active vs. inactive). It enables users to see trends over time, observing changes in active versus inactive customer counts annually. This insight helps the bank understand patterns in customer engagement year by year.

<br />

- <b>Donut Chart</b>  <br/>
This visualization breaks down Exit Customers by Gender. The donut chart offers a clear view of whether there is a gender-based trend in customer exits, helping to identify if specific demographics may be more prone to leaving.

<br />

- <b>Pie Chart</b>  <br/>
Displaying Exit Customers by Category, the pie chart segments exit trends into different categories (e.g., account type, service usage). This helps pinpoint which customer categories are more likely to churn, aiding in targeted retention efforts for specific groups.

<br />

- <b>Clustered Bar Chart</b>  <br/>
This chart shows Exit Customers by Credit Score. It helps visualize if certain credit score ranges correlate with higher exit rates, allowing the bank to address retention strategies based on customers’ creditworthiness or financial behavior.

<br />

- <b>Line Chart</b>  <br/>
The line chart compares Exit Customers and Previous Month Exit Customers by month. This trend analysis offers insights into monthly fluctuations, helping the bank track seasonal or event-driven spikes in exits to preemptively implement retention measures during high-churn periods.

<br />

- <b>Smart Narrative </b>  <br/>
The Smart Narrative tool generates a text summary of key insights directly within the dashboard. It provides automated explanations and observations of the data, such as trends, outliers, and drivers behind the visuals, making it easier for stakeholders to interpret complex metrics without needing to delve into each visualization.

<h2>Dashboard walk-through:</h2>

The dashboard is designed for interactive analysis, allowing users to filter data based on Year, Month, Geographic Location, Gender Category, Exit Category, and Active Status. Each filter selection dynamically updates all the visualizations and key metrics, creating a customized view of customer behavior and exit trends.

- Year Selection: This filter enables users to focus on data for a specific year. When selected, all the metrics and charts adjust to display information for that particular year, making it easy to spot year-over-year changes in customer activity and retention.

- Month Selection: By choosing a specific month, users can narrow down data to analyze customer exits and retention patterns on a monthly basis, providing insights into seasonal or time-specific trends in customer behavior.

- Geographic Location Filter: Users can select a geographic region, adjusting the dashboard to only show data for customers within that location. This is helpful for identifying regional trends in customer exits, allowing for more targeted retention efforts.

- Gender Category Filter: This filter allows users to examine data based on gender. Selecting a specific gender dynamically changes all metrics and visualizations to reflect customer activity for that demographic, uncovering any gender-based trends in customer retention or exits.

- Exit Category Filter: Users can filter by exit category to focus on specific reasons for customer attrition. This feature provides a clear view of the various exit reasons, helping the bank develop strategies tailored to address specific churn drivers.

- Active Category Filter: This filter enables users to analyze data based on customers' activity status (active or inactive). By focusing on active versus inactive customers, users can better understand retention patterns and identify areas for improvement.

The dashboard’s interactive features ensure that users receive a comprehensive, tailored analysis based on their selections, which helps in drawing actionable insights and developing customer-centric strategies.
